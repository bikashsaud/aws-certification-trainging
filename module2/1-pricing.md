### How do you pay for AWS?
- **Pay for what you use**
  - You only pay for the resources you use, no more, no less.
- **Pay less when you reserve**
  - If you need a resource for a long time, you can usually get a discount by reserving it.
- **Pay less when you use more**
  - If you use a lot of a resource, you can usually get a discount by using more.
- **Pay even less as AWS grows**
  - AWS reduces the price of resources as it grows capacity and improves efficiency.
