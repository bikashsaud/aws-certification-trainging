### Section 2: Advantages of cloud computing

Key Advantage
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense: trade capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx). In traditional IT, organizations must invest heavily upfront in physical infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking equipment, leading to significant capital expenditures. These costs are incurred regardless of how much the resources are used, potentially leading to underutilization. With AWS, you shift to a variable expense model, where you pay only for the resources you actually use.
2. Massive economies of scale: 
    Imagine a small business needs 100 servers to run its operations. If they buy and maintain these servers themselves (traditional IT), they face high costs for equipment, power, cooling, and maintenance. 

    With AWS, they don't need to buy servers. AWS can serve thousands of businesses like theirs using a massive global infrastructure, buying resources in bulk. Because of this, AWS can offer the same 100 servers at a lower price, only charging for the time they're actually used. This way, the small business benefits from AWS's large-scale operations, saving money and avoiding the complexities of managing physical servers.

3. Stop guessing capacity: AWS eliminates the need to guess capacity by offering automatic scaling of resources based on actual usage. Instead of over-provisioning or under-provisioning, businesses can easily adjust their server capacity in real-time to match demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency without the complexities of managing physical infrastructure.

4. Increase speed and agility: AWS increases speed and agility by allowing businesses to quickly deploy and scale applications without the delays of traditional IT setups. Organizations can launch new projects, experiment with innovations, and respond to market changes rapidly, enabling them to stay competitive and efficiently meet customer demands with minimal upfront investment.
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes: AWS enables businesses to go global in minutes by providing a vast network of data centers worldwide. Organizations can easily deploy applications and services in multiple regions, ensuring low latency and high availability for users around the globe. This rapid expansion helps companies reach new markets and enhance customer experiences quickly.
