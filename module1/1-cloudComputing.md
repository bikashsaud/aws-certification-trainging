## Module 1

### Objectives
- Define different types of cloud computing models
- Describe six advantages of cloud computing
- Recognize the main AWS service categories and core services
- Review the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

### Section 1: Introduction to cloud computing
- Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, allowing users to access and use resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, without needing to manage the underlying physical infrastructure. Instead of owning and maintaining their own data centers or servers, businesses and individuals can use cloud services provided by companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others.

    #### Types of Cloud Computing Services:

    - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples include virtual machines, storage, and networks. AWS EC2 and Google Compute Engine are examples of IaaS.

    - Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. Examples include Google App Engine and Microsoft Azure App Service.

    - Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Users can access software via a web browser without installing or managing it themselves. Examples include Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Office 365.

    #### Traditional computing model
    The traditional computing model, often referred to as on-premises computing or client-server computing, is the conventional approach where organizations manage and maintain their own physical infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking equipment, within their own facilities. In this model, all computing resources and data are hosted locally within an organizationâ€™s own data centers or server rooms.

    #### Cloud computing model
    1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking. Users manage the OS, apps, and data. Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.

    2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure. Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.

    3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access software via a web browser. Examples: Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365.

    #### Deployment Models
    1. Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across multiple customers. Examples: AWS, Google Cloud.

    2. Private Cloud: Dedicated to a single organization, offering more control and security. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.

    3. Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them for greater flexibility.

    4. Community Cloud: Shared by several organizations with common interests or requirements, such as security and compliance.

    #### Similarities between AWS and traditional IT

    - Computing Resources: Both AWS and traditional IT provide essential computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking. These resources are fundamental for running applications, processing data, and managing IT environments.

    - Data Management: Both models require data management practices, including backup, storage, retrieval, and disaster recovery. Data security, integrity, and compliance are critical in both environments.

    - Networking: Networking is crucial in both AWS and traditional IT. This includes setting up networks, managing traffic, and ensuring secure communication between systems and users.

    - Security: Security measures like firewalls, encryption, access control, and monitoring are important in both AWS and traditional IT to protect data and resources.

    - Application Hosting: Both models support the deployment and hosting of applications, ranging from small websites to complex enterprise systems.

    - Maintenance and Monitoring: Regular maintenance, monitoring, and performance optimization are required in both AWS and traditional IT to ensure systems run efficiently and meet user needs.
